## By Maia Woluchem, Anthony Sciola, and Jay Dev

## Introduction

> Jay: Have you ever been to Ohio?
 
> Anthony: I have, but I don't recommend it.

In this project, we are attempting to do the unwise: make recommendations in favor of Ohio. Using data from reviews in Ohio, available through Yelp's 12th Data Set Challenge data, we have created several recommendation models using linear regression, regularized regression, matrix factorization, and k-nearest neighbors and Pearson's R distance.

As predicted in the project assignment, our recommenders are neither particularly effective nor sophisticated. But through this process, we have learned about handling and modeling large sets of data, alternating least squares and distance-based modeling methods, and the importance of committing changes on GitHub.
